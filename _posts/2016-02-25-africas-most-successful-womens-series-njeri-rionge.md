description: "Ever heard of a serial entrepreneur? Well neither had I until I stumbled on Njeri Rionge, one of Kenya's most successful and revered serial entrepreneurs. Rionge co-founded multi-million dollar companies in quick succession. A 36 year old mom, she co-founded Wananchi Online, a leading Internet service provider which has gone on to become East Africa's leading cable, broadband and IP (Internet-based) Phone Company."
