description: 'The intrinsic nature of women is to nurture, harmonize and align, wanting to make good everything we do. This is possible, of course, only if you have the requisite confidence to engage in self-reflection, acknowledge and accept your weaknesses, and are ready to embark on developing and trusting your intrinsic female skills and competencies.'
